### Positions {.no-hide}

If you map `fill` to a new variable, `geom_bar()` will display a _stacked_ bar chart:

```{r out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

This plot displays 40 different combinations of `cut` and `clarity`, each displayed by its own rectangle. `geom_bar()` lays out the rectangles by stacking rectangles that have the same `cut` value on top of one another. You can change this behavior with a _position adjustment_.

### `position = "dodge"`

To place rectangles that have the same `cut` value beside each other, set `position = "dodge"`.

```{r out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")
```

This plot shows the same rectangles as the previous chart; however, it lays out rectangles that have the same `cut` value _beside_ each other.

### `position = "stack"`

To create the familiar stacked bar chart, set `position = "stack"` (which is the default for `geom_bar()`).

```{r out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "stack")
```

### `position="fill"`

To expand each bar to take up the entire $y$ axis, set `position = "fill"`. {ggplot2} will stack the rectangles and then scale them within each bar.

```{r out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill")
```

This makes it easy to _compare proportions_. For example, you can scan across the bars to see how the proportion of `IF` diamonds changes from cut to cut. 

### What is a position adjustment?

Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a `position` argument that is preset to a reasonable default. You can use `position` to determine how a geom should adjust objects that would otherwise overlap with each other. 

For example, in our plot, each value of `cut` is associated with eight rectangles: one each for `I1`, `SI2`, `SI1`, `VS2`, `VS1`, `VVS2`, `VVS1`, and `IF`. Each of these eight rectangles deserves to go in the same place: directly above the value of `cut` that it is associated with, with the bottom of the rectangle placed at count = 0. But if we plotted the plot like that, the rectangles would overlap each other.

Here's what that would look like if you could peek around the side of the graph.

### `position = "identity"`

…and here's what that would look like if you could see the graph from the front. You can make this plot by setting `position = "identity"`. 

```{r out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "identity")
```

Position adjustments tell {ggplot2} how to re-distribute objects when they overlap. `position = "identity"` is the "adjustment" that lets objects overlap each other. It is a bad choice for bar graphs because the result looks like a stacked bar chart, even though it is not. 

### Exercise 6: Positions

Use the code chunk to recreate the plot you see below. Remember: `color` is the name of a variable in `diamonds` (not to be confused with an aesthetic).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = clarity), position = "fill", width = 1)
```
