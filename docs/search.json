The package is pre-installed for you, just as {ggplot2} was pre-installed in the last tutorial. But unlike in the last tutorial, I have not pre-loaded {babynames}, or any other package.\nWhat does this mean? In R, whenever you want to use a package that is not part of base R, you need to load the package with the command library(). Until you load a package, R will not be able to find the datasets and functions contained in the package. For example, if we asked R to display the babynames dataset, which comes in the {babynames} package, right now, we’d get the message below. R cannot find the dataset because we haven’t loaded the {babynames} package.\n\nbabynames\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'babynames' not found\n\n\nTo load the {babynames} package, you would run the command library(babynames). After you load a package, R will be able to find its contents until you close R. The next time you open R, you will need to reload the package if you wish to use it again.\nThis might sound like an inconvenience, but choosing which packages to load keeps your R experience simple and orderly.\nIn the chunk below, load {babynames} (the package) and then open the help page for babynames (the dataset).

Each plot uses a different visual object to represent the data. In ggplot2 syntax, we say that they use different geoms.\nA geom is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent observations. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point geom.\nAs we see above, you can use different geoms to plot the same data. The plot on the left uses the point geom, and the plot on the right uses the smooth geom, a smooth line fitted to the data.",
